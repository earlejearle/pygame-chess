### Getting setup
I used pyenv ([tutorial for mac here](https://medium.com/marvelous-mlops/the-rightway-to-install-python-on-a-mac-f3146d9d9a32))
to get my python environment setup.

Once you have python just run
`pip intall pygame`

#### Specific versions
- Python: 3.12.2
- pygame: 2.5.2
- however pretty sure any python >= 3 is fine, and whatever latest pygame you get should be fine too
